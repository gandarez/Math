## Adjacent Points

Ggiven a non-empty zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers, returns the maximum distance between indices of this array that have adjacent values. The function should return −2 if no adjacent indices exist.

- N is an integer within the range [1..40,000]
- Each element of array A is an integer within the range [−2,147,483,648..2,147,483,647]
